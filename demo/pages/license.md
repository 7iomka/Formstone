# License

Formstone will be moving from the MIT to GNU GPL v3 for all open source applications, and a commercial license will be required for all commercial applications (including sites, themes and apps).

We did not come to this decision lightly and understand it may not be the most popular move, but do feel it is necessary to help offset the cost of maintaining the code quality our users expect. We'll have more details soon, including where to purchase a commercial license.
